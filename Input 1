So I have found a way to output only 1 layer ofthe current directory along with size of each directory.
I will try to add this to a batch script and make it output, then see if I can get values from this.

$ du -h --max-depth=1


1.0K    ./.android
324K    ./.eclipse
47K     ./.git
1.0K    ./.oracle_jre_usage
5.0K    ./.p2
5.0K    ./.ssh
380K    ./.VirtualBox
