What I've done:
So after just using a command I decided to input it into a batch script.
after some research I found out how to set up such a batch file.

script:

#i/bin/bash
echo "files"

du -h --max-depth=1


Output:

$ ./Assignment1.sh
files
1.0K    ./.android
324K    ./.eclipse
47K     ./.git
1.0K    ./.oracle_jre_usage
5.0K    ./.p2
5.0K    ./.ssh
380K    ./.VirtualBox


What needs to be done next:

So i need to try and find a way to split the output up so I can add the hashes to each line, I also need to find take the total size of the files to get the directorys size.
