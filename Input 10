What I have done:
I have now got a sperate 'Main' batch file that will check to see if dialog has been installed. I will now be able to run seperate code depending on if it installed.

Main.sh : 
yum -q list installed steam &>/dev/null && ./File.sh || echo "Not installed"

What to do next: 
I will now create a basic text output that does not use dialog but gives similar output to the dialog one, replacing the text output "Not installed".
