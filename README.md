# Assignment---2
Using batch script to show files/folders information inside a directory, such as size and name

So the assignment wants the me to create a batch script that will show each file/folder inside the directory along with the sizes of each and to use a traversing algorithm to do so. I have used dialog to give the user a better GUI, but have also got a basic text command line menu and I/O if dialog is not available on the machine.

How to set up:
- create the 4 batch files that have been submitted to Assignment 2
  - Main.sh
  - Basic.sh
  - File.sh
  - trav.sh
- Make sure that all files are in the same directory and have the same names as the files have been submitted.
- Change the executable state of each batch file to true.
- Run main.sh for automatic selection between dialog GUI and basic Text GUI.
