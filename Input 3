What I've done:
Ive managed to output my bash file to a text document, I hope I can use this to do the calculations for the hashes. I could consider using a different programming language to do this? I know it would be easy to do in java but I'm not sure how I'd set an application of with this.
script:

#i/bin/bash
echo "Size(MB)  files"
du -h -m --max-depth=1 "D:\games" > mapped.txt

Output:
(to a text file)
519	D:\games/empire_earth_gold_edition
1642	D:\games/KSP_win
292	D:\games/my games
347	D:\games/Nexus Mod Manager
544	D:\games/star_wars_galactic_battlegrounds_saga
97	D:\games/Timber and Stone
137	D:\games/zineth_0_24
3575	D:\games

What needs to be done next:
Look into how to manipulate the text file, I may look into using java if neccesary!
