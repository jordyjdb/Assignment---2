What I've done:
So after trying and failing to compile the C correctly at home, I decided to go to java which is easier to work with in my opinion and easier to run. Again, I only created a test program to make sure that the java would
-find the file
-read the file
-output back to the file
With this Java program, it finds and reads the file, however I need to but a bit more effort in to make it write back to the file.

Java:
import java.io.*;

public class Reader {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//file directory
		String fileName = "C:\\Users\\jordyjdb\\mapped.txt";
		//Line of file
		String line = null;
		
		 try {
			FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(fileName);
			 BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);
			 while((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
	                System.out.println(line);
	            }   

	            // Always close files.
	            bufferedReader.close();    
		} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
			System.out.println("File not found.");
		}
		 catch(IOException ex){
			 System.out.println("Error reading file.");
		 }
		
	}

}


Output:
519	D:\games/empire_earth_gold_edition
1642	D:\games/KSP_win
292	D:\games/my games
347	D:\games/Nexus Mod Manager
544	D:\games/star_wars_galactic_battlegrounds_saga
97	D:\games/Timber and Stone
137	D:\games/zineth_0_24
3575	D:\games
3575	total

What needs to be done next:
I need to give the program the ability to write back to file, I need to also compile the code and then call the program from my bash script.
