What I've done:

So I looked further into using a different language to edit the output of the mapped directory and C seems to be the best option. Although I am currenly having running it, so maybe I'll have better luck in a VM or on one of the machines at uni.
My C program is currently testing the input of a file.
script:

#i/bin/bash
echo "Size(MB)  files"
du -h -m --max-depth=1 "D:\games" > mapped.txt
./main
echo "C program is running"
sleep(2)
cat mapped.txt

C:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("attempting to read file...");
    
    FILE *pToFile = fopen("mapped.txt","r");
    
    int line = 0;
    char input[1000];
    
    while( fgets(input, 1000,pToFile)){
        line++;
        printf("line:%d -> %s", line, input);
    }
    
    printf("finished reading file!")
    fclose(pToFile);

    return 0;
}



Output:
(errors)
./Assignment1.sh: line 4: ./main: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
./Assignment1.sh: line 6: syntax error near unexpected token `2'
./Assignment1.sh: line 6: `sleep(2)'


What needs to be done next:
Edit my C program once finished with testing so that it configures file and outputs back to the file.
Make my C program work, try VM.
